# Welcome to EightyThree Apps

Welcome to our new website! We're excited to share our journey in creating modern web applications with beautiful, functional designs.

## What Makes Us Different

Our approach to web development focuses on three core principles:

1. **Modern Design** - We create interfaces that are not only beautiful but also intuitive and accessible
2. **Performance** - Every application we build is optimized for speed and efficiency
3. **User Experience** - We prioritize the end user in every decision we make

## Our Technology Stack

We use cutting-edge technologies to deliver the best possible experience:

- **Next.js 15** - The React framework for production
- **React 19** - The latest version of React with improved performance
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript for better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development

## Frosted Glass Aesthetic

One of our signature design elements is the frosted glass effect, which creates depth and visual interest while maintaining readability. This effect is achieved using CSS `backdrop-filter` and carefully crafted color schemes that work in both light and dark themes.

## What's Next

We're constantly working on new projects and improving our existing ones. Stay tuned for updates on our latest work and insights into modern web development.

Thank you for visiting, and we look forward to working with you!
